# PPTReader
This langchain application gives you the capability to talk to the PPT(.pptx) you upload.
I started making this a night before my end semester exam when I had a lot of slides to go through.

# Approach
I have used two models namely:
  1. Cohere
  2. OpenAI
Cohere provides free trial API key which allows you 5 API calls per minute but it is a bit inefficient on csv data files therefore I wanted to try with OpenAI API key. The issue with OpenAI is that it is paid and can't be used without a subscription. Therefore, I have written the basic code for anyone to use OpenAI agent if they have the subscription.

Hence, my goal of learning a night before failed but I guess its fine

The ppt which I am refering to is also given.
